I want to learn about Rust and emulator programming. So, what better way to achieve those aims than to smash both intimidating subjects into one scary project!

Not sure how far I will get with this.. But if I fail miserably I'll hopefully learn lots of cool stuff along the way.

There isn't much of a plan at the moment. I'm just seeing where things take me for now.

Here is my initial checklist:
 * **Read some Spectrum data** - TZX seems to be one of the better defined and documented file formats out there right now (based on http://www.worldofspectrum.org/TZXformat.html) so let's try and read one of those and parse it.
 * **Get some Z80 instructions out of the data** - Z80 assembly seems to be relatively simple. I should hopefully be able to make a crude disassembler to reverse spectrum machine code back to Z80 mnemonics.
 * **Try to emulate a Z80 processor** - Can I execute the machine code?
 * **Side thoughts** - I should be able to grab SCREEN$ data and render it as a basic proof of concept perhaps?
